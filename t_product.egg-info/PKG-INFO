The following package contains the different tools required in implementing the t-product. 

# 1. Requirements
1) Numpy
2) Scipy

# 2. Functions

## Unfold
Unfolding Tensor by frontal slices.

## Bcirc
Circulant Matrix based on frontal slices.

## Fold
Folding Matrix back to tensor by frontal slice.

## T-Product
Implementation of t-product for tensors.

## M_hat
Moving tensor into Fourier domain.

## Identity Tesnor
Creates identity tesnor with respect to t-product.

## ConjT
Implements conjugate transpose of tensor with respect to t-product.

## Inverse Row Slices
Calculates inverse for row slices product with its conjugate transpose (refer to [Anna Ma's and Denali Molitor's paper TRK](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.01246)).

## Recover Hat
Recovers tensor from Fourier domain.

This package is result of the theoretical results derived from two papers: ["Factorization strategies for third-order tensors": by Misha E. Kilmer, and Carla D. Martin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024379510004830), and ["Randomized Kaczmarz for Tensor Linear Systems" by Anna Ma, and Denali Molitor](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.01246). Further theoretical results are present in both papers.
